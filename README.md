<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Challenge 12 involves creating a command-line employee tracker application. Completing this challenge allowed me to demonstrate my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Javascript (including Node, MySql, and Console.Table).</p> 

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Make sure to have GitBash, Node.js, and VSCode installed for sucess. Further installations would be to install NPM MySql, NPM Console.Table, and NPM Inquirer.</p>

<h2>Useage</h2>
<p>Fist, install all node packages by entering 'npm i' into the command line. Once installations are complete, type 'node server.js' into the command line. You'll know application is ready to use once you are prompted by the app to select a feature.</p>

<h2>Contribution</h2>
<p>Feel free to message me if you have any ideas on how to make this better!</p>

<h2>Test</h2>
<p>No tests were required for this project. That doesn't mean it's a bad idea to include for future, however!</p>
